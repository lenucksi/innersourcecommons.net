It utilizes open source methods to provide organizations pursuing inner sourcing a forum for discussing and improving the practice of InnerSource through the sharing of experiences (under the <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule">Chatham House Rule</a>), creation and review of InnerSource patterns, and the open exchange of ideas.<h3 id="who-should-attend">Who should attend?</h3><p>The InnerSource Common Summits welcomes software professionals at all levels, from executive level manager to software developer. The program targets software development managers and executive managers in particular because adopting InnerSource requires significant efforts to make changes in the organization—whether these are implemented top-down or bottom-up. If you or your organization is adopting, or considering adopting, InnerSource, then attending the InnerSource Summit is the best thing you can do.<h3 id="what-will-i-get-from-this-event">What will I get from this event?</h3><p>The three key reasons to attend the InnerSource Common Summits are:<ul><li>Learn from others who are on the journey of InnerSource adoption<li>Share your experiences and get help with your challenges<li>Network, network, network!
